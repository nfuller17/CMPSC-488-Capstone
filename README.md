## The Game
**Objective**: Find and collect 8 purple materials scattered around the arena while avoiding or defeating enemies. Each material must be returned to the central area where the player has spawned. After collecting all materials, a Boss enemy is spawned and the player must use the provided super weapon to defeat it and win the game.

**Features**:
- A variety of weapons, from melee to instant-hit rifles and rapid firing projectiles. Weapons must be picked up throughout the map and can be accessed with the number keys 0 - 9.
- A skill system where energy is increased over time. Once the energy bar is full, use the scroll wheel to select a skill and right mouse-click to activate. Skills include regenerating health, increasing speed, deploying a shield, or increasing the player's weapon firing rate.
- Allies that can be called up on to aid players as they scout for materials.
- Different enemy types with attacks ranging from melee to projectile.
- Pickups for providing health, ammo, and energy.
