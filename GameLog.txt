*********************************************************** TO DO ***********************************************************
- Fix AI spazzing out sometimes during combat
- Add some graphics, such as material icons, to instructions menu
- Sound effects for minions, boss, pickups
- Fix Mage/Muriel projectiles sometimes not colliding with walls
- Add win/lose screen
- Gameplay balance
- AI:
	- If AI takes damage, have AI turn in the direction from where it was hit. AI vision can then take care of the rest to detect for an enemy (if enough time)
	- Add skill branch/nodes to behavior tree for Friendly AI (if enough time)
