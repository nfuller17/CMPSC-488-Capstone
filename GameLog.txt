*********************************************************** TO DO ***********************************************************
- AI:
	- Implement melee on AI
	- Implement dodging and strafing on AI
		* Allow AI vision to detect for projectiles that are traveling toward the AI's general direction
	- If AI takes damage, have AI turn in the direction from where it was hit. AI vision can then take care of the rest to detect for an enemy
	- Improve AI roaming
		* Currently, AI roams map by picking a random point within a radius. However, this is not human-like, and AI could end up moving back and forth between spots
		* Suggested algorithm: Pick a random point, and only go there if it is within AI's view (i.e. use Vision to pick new point to roam)
	- Add skill branch/nodes to behavior tree for Friendly AI
	- Add sprint skill (mostly for melee AI when implemented)
	- Add thermal sensor skill
- Spectator mode
	- Player controller should be fixed on AI for conference demonstration
	- If in spectator mode, spawn friendly AI outright so there is some action.. should friendly AI attempt to collect materials?
	- If possible, left click = view another AI, right click = allow player camera to roam map?
	- Player can enter spectator mode from main menu perhaps?
- Create Super weapon
	- Have boss be immune to normal weapons
	- What to do if player dies with Super weapon?
- Implement lives on player
	- End the game in lose state if number of lives = 0
- Re-design HUD
	- Have health be a progress bar instead of a number
	- Have ammo be a number instead of a progress bar
	- Icons for different weapons?
	- Add a HUD element to indicate how many materials there are to collect, e.g. 2 / 5, or a transparent icon if not collected and opaque icon if collected
	- Add a HUD element to indicate how many lives the player has
- Implement splash damage on projectiles
- Fix projectile collision with world geometry (if shot at a certain angle, projectile will move along with geometry)
	- Check ordering of Actor components in blueprint - collision componenent should probably come first
- Fix player pawn falling through map after dying (maybe wait a few seconds after death to turn collision off)
- Fix dodging - player should dodge if and only if same key is pressed twice in rapid succession, i.e. pressing W then D should not make the player dodge right (but it currently does)
- Fix melee weapons - ray trace should start from player pawn or weapon, and not from camera (since this is no longer first-person)
- Sound effects for weapons, projectiles, impacts, maybe footsteps.. game music?
- Fix animations when characters are airborne - turn off walking animation, play airborne animation
- Gameplay balance
- Improve OOP design (if time permits - and this could lead to unseen errors)
	- Two broad classes, PawnJerry and Monster, share several attributes that can be combined into one class, e.g. Health, Team, TakeDamage, Death, etc.
	- Would make some code look much cleaner
