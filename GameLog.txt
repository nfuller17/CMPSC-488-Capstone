*********************************************************** TO DO ***********************************************************
- Add some graphics, such as material icons, to instructions menu
- Fix dodging on AI - maybe make them strafe instead of launching them
- Re-design HUD
	- Have health be a progress bar instead of a number
	- Have ammo be a number instead of a progress bar
	- Light up the weapon slot for the current weapon the player is carrying
- New player model for boss
- Implement splash damage on projectiles
- Fix player pawn falling through map after dying (maybe wait a few seconds after death to turn collision off)
- Remove death animations from minions/allies, and instead play a visiual effect when they die
- Fix melee weapons - ray trace should start from player pawn or weapon, and not from camera (since this is no longer first-person)
- Sound effects for minions, boss
- Fix animations when characters are airborne - turn off walking animation, play airborne animation
- Gameplay balance
- Fix projectile collision with world geometry (if shot at a certain angle, projectile will move along with geometry)
	- Check ordering of Actor components in blueprint - collision componenent should probably come first
	- Do this if enough time
- AI:
	- If AI takes damage, have AI turn in the direction from where it was hit. AI vision can then take care of the rest to detect for an enemy (if enough time)
	- Add skill branch/nodes to behavior tree for Friendly AI (if enough time)
