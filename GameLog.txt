*********************************************************** TO DO ***********************************************************
- AI:
	- If AI takes damage, have AI turn in the direction from where it was hit. AI vision can then take care of the rest to detect for an enemy (if enough time)
	- Add skill branch/nodes to behavior tree for Friendly AI (if enough time)
- Re-design HUD
	- Have health be a progress bar instead of a number
	- Have ammo be a number instead of a progress bar
	- Icons for different weapons?
- Implement splash damage on projectiles
- Fix projectile collision with world geometry (if shot at a certain angle, projectile will move along with geometry)
	- Check ordering of Actor components in blueprint - collision componenent should probably come first
	- Do this if enough time
- Fix player pawn falling through map after dying (maybe wait a few seconds after death to turn collision off)
- Fix minions/boss mesh not falling upon death
	- As an alternative, instead of playing a death animation, play a visual effect like a flash to simulate death
- Fix melee weapons - ray trace should start from player pawn or weapon, and not from camera (since this is no longer first-person)
- Sound effects for minions, boss
- Fix animations when characters are airborne - turn off walking animation, play airborne animation
- Gameplay balance
