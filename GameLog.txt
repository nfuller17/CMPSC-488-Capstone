*********************************************************** TO DO ***********************************************************
[HIGH PRIORITY]
- Fix AI shooting projectiles at player after death
- Add win/lose screen

[LOWER PRIORITY]
- If a factory attempts to spawn a pickup while the player is standing on top of it, that factory will not spawn any more pickups
- Fix AI spazzing out sometimes during combat
- Add some graphics, such as material icons, to instructions menu
- Sound effects for minions, boss, pickups
- Fix Mage/Muriel projectiles sometimes not colliding with walls
- AI:
	- If AI takes damage, have AI turn in the direction from where it was hit. AI vision can then take care of the rest to detect for an enemy (if enough time)
	- Add skill branch/nodes to behavior tree for Friendly AI (if enough time)
